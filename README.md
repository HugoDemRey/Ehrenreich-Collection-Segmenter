# Ehrenreich Collection Segmenter
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/OWNER/REPO)]([https://github.com/HugoDemRey/Ehrenreich-Collection-Segmenter/releases])
Automated opera segmentation for the historic Ehrenreich Collection using computational audio analysis techniques.

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of automatically segmenting opera recordings into their structural components (arias, ensembles, orchestral interludes). Working with the historic Ehrenreich Collection, a unique archive of bootleg opera recordings spanning 1965 to 2010, this research develops computational methods to identify movement boundaries that would otherwise require manual annotation by experts. The project combines multiple audio signal processing methods, and a user interface design.

This interface is an interactive PyQt6 application that was developed to allow any user to explore different segmentation methods, tune parameters in real-time, and compare results across multiple approaches.
